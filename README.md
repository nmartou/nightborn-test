## Decisions

I wanted to start with the visual first pages (home page and detailed page) and have at least one element of each topic from required elements. I started to split all the possible components to use them with the easiest way.

## What to improve with more time

- Have a complete functinnal API
- Have a better Responsive design for small devices
- Add a creation modal for new todo
